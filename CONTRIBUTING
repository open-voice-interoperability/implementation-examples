# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in the implementation examples repository for the LFAI and Data Open Voice Interoperability project! Our project is just getting off the ground and contributions from new participants are most welcome. This repository contains examples of implementations of our emerging standards for interoperable conversational assistants. Basically, they illustrate how two or more independent assistants can cooperate to transfer conversations from one assistant to another. You can fork the repository and experiment with the current assistants, or use the examples as a basis for implementing an assistant of your own. Please submit a pull request when you have an implementation that you'd like to contribute.
